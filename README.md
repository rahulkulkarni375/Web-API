# Web-API
Here you will get the basic knowledge and understanding about web api' and some mini projects so that you can to know how they work

## Introduction
A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. As a web development concept, it can be related to a web application's client side. A server-side web API consists of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined requestâ€“response message system.

Key aspects of a web API include:

- Protocol : Http/s communication protocols define how data is transmitted between client and server.
- Endpoints: APIs expose endpoints (URLs) that clients can send requests to.
- Operations: APIs define operations that clients can perform (CRUD).
- Data Formats: APIs specify data formats for request and response payloads.
- Authentication and Authorization: APIs often include mechanisms for authenticating clients and authorizing access to specific resources.


#### What is REST API ?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST architectural style. REST is not a standard, but rather a set of guidelines and best practices for creating scalable and maintainable web services


#### what is GraphQL ?
GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that gives API clients exactly the data they requested. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.
